Crate for handling groups of unknown order.

I've seen this commonly across multiple projects where they need a multiprecision library
and use one of three libraries: [Gnu MP BigNum Library](https://gmplib.org/), [OpenSSL's BigNum Library](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/bn.html)
and [Rust's BigInt Library](https://crates.io/crates/num-bigint), depending on the needs and requirements (licensing, performance, platform target, constant time).

The default is to use the pure rust option without any external C bindings. This version is also
friendly to WASM.

To use OpenSSL's BigNum library, you must have libcrypto and libssl in your path.
Put the following in your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
unknown_order = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["openssl"] }
```

To use Gnu MP BigNum library, you must have libgmp in your path.
Put the following in your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
unknown_order = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["gmp"] }
```

This library wraps them all into a common API, so they can be used interchangeably.

Groups of unknown order require using a modulus that is the composite of two big prime numbers. This
library is designed to facilitate these use cases such as RSA, [Paillier](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-48910-X_16.pdf), [Hyperelliptic Curves](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/196),
[Accumulators](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188), [CL signatures](http://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/papers/camlys02b.pdf).

The modulus is not known at compile time which excludes using certain traits like `ff::PrimeField`, so
unfortunately, the caller needs to remember to use methods prefixed with `mod` to achieve the desired results.

This library can only have one implementation active at a time. Mixing between implementations isn't necessarily a
problem as much as injecting lots of dependencies and mixing licenses which is not a good idea. 
This also forces the user to understand what tradeoffs they are making when they select a specific implementation.
For example, some implementations may not be constant time versus others which is important when used for cryptographic purposes.

When using `features=openssl` or `features=gmp`, the constant time implementations are used if available.

## Examples

```rust
use unknown_order::BigNumber;

fn main() {
    // Create a safe group of unknown order
    let p = BigNumber::safe_prime(1024);
    let q = BigNumber::safe_prime(1024);
    let n = p.clone() * q.clone();
    
    // Simulate RSA algorithm, DO NOT USE totally insecure
    
    // Public key
    let e = BigNumber::from(65537);
    
    // throw away when done
    let totient = (p.clone() - 1) * (q.clone() - 1);
    
    // Secret key
    let d = e.invert(&totient).unwrap();
    
    
}
```
